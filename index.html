        <h3>
            The 2016 election is, and will likely remain for a while, the most closely analyzed election in American history.
            (It's also the last presidential election I can find a good county-level dataset for.)
            Donald Trump overturned decades of conventional wisdom, taking down the Democratic "blue wall" in the Midwest and 
            flipping many areas Republicans had feared lost after two straight losses in 2008 and 2012. By looking at where now-President
            Trump outperformed previous Republicans, and what demographic characteristics correlated with his success, 
            we might be able to figure out why.

            Use the following buttons to look at the corresponding variables by county in the US!
            Remember, counties don't have the same amounts of people in them -- you can barely see New
            York City on the map, but it has a greater population than all but 11 <i>states</i>. If you click on
            a county, you can see its percentile rank nationally in the demographic categories on the spider chart below.

        <h3>
            OK, that spider chart was cool, but it doesn't tell us anything about support for Trump or Clinton as a whole. 
            Let's take a look at the demographic factors most correlated with Trump's margin of victory. Remember, there are thousands
            of counties in the US, so these might get a little messy. And once again, click a bubble to find out more about the county.

        <h3>
            It seems from these scatterplots that Trump performed better in counties
            with lower populations, more voters who were white, old, or rural, with lower 
            median incomes, and with fewer foreign-born or college-educated residents.
        </h3>

        <h3>
            Remember, by the way, that we're grouping this data <i>by county.</i> For example, you might 
            have been surprised that the richest counties in the country voted Democrat, but it's likely
            that the countries with the highest median income are urban and suburban, and therefore lean blue;
            I'm going out on a limb here, but it's also possible that the richest Republicans are more likely to
            live in heavily Democratic urban areas where our metric might not weight them heavily (remember, <i>median</i>, 
            not average.) 
        </h3>

        <h3>
            But we also see that the spread of these variables is relatively large, and there are plenty of outliers.
            There are heavily white Democratic counties, Republican counties with many immigrants, very rural blue counties, 
            and very educated red counties. Demographic analysis of voting can be dangerous, because it allows us to place
            each other into neat little boxes. This approach is simple; it is also deeply flawed. The above graphs tell us a lot
            about how Americans vote as a whole, but they tell us <i>nothing</i> about how any single individual votes.
